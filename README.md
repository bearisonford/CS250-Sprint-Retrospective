# CS250-Sprint-Retrospective

    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    
    In order to interpret user needs and implement them into a program we must go to the source to determine what those
    needs might be.  In the SNHU Travel project the Product Owner first determined the scope of the project by working 
    with the client, SNHU Travel.  The Product Owner then held an information session with some of the end users of the 
    website to get their needs for a travel website. With that information the Product Owner can use the approach of 
    asking three simple questions: Who am I? What do I want? What do I expect from it? Answering these three questions 
    will allow the Product Owner to write User Stories to populate the Product Backlog with. 
    
    User Stories help implement the user needs into a program by creating actionable items that can be used to establish
    acceptence criteria, testing requirements, and allow for work planning.
    
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    
    In developing programs for coursework in the past I worked backwards in my thought process on how to meet the end
    requirement.  If the program needs to do Z, what items will I need to complete that?  Then what items will need
    to be available to complete those items?  I would then break down what items to work on at a time, test them as
    I was writing the code, then move on to the next item when functional.  Looking at it now, I feel recognize this as
    a loose agile processes, utilizing pseudo user stories, sprint-like work blocks, and rudementary Test-Driven Development.
    I hope to build upon those processes and incorporate sizing and better tracking methods, like a Kanban.
    
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    
    A good team member in software development is someone who practices self-ownership, willing to correct issues when
    confronted, demonstrates integrety, has courage, able to coach others and demonstrates several of the Agile Principles.
